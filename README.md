## Project Overview
_Geometric Gallery Prototype_ allows audiences a glimpse into the power of Processing to produce interactive sketches through algorithmic visual outputs. I created this project with the goal of challenging myself to work with the medium of Java within Processing, with which I had very little prior experience. The prototype provided me a unique opportunity to expand my digital communication skill set as someone who hopes to pursue a career in visual storytelling. I anticipated that this distinct intersection of areas of exploration would create problem-solving situations I would be unlikely to otherwise encounter, and it most certainly did.


## Technical Specifications
- Processing Development Environment 4 (PDE)
- Language of Java
- No additional extensions, plugins, or APIs


## Features and Usage
- Title card featuring a one-line description of the project as well as keyboard controls.
- 6 total, unique sketches, some animated, some not.
- Use "SPACE" key to proceed to the next sketch.
- Can additionally press "ENTER" key to redraw each sketch.
- Will loop from beginning when all sketches have been cycled through.

## Setup
1. Open the .pde file in Processing (Java Mode).
2. Click "Run" to start the prototype.
3. See above (or the title screen text) for keyboard controls.

- This project was inspired primarily by community creations shared by individuals through [openprocessing.org](https://openprocessing.org).
- Additionally, I supplemented my coding with close study of Derek Runberg's 2015 _The SparkFun guide to Processing : create interactive art with code_, as accessible through UTS Library.
