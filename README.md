## Project Overview
I created this project with the goal of challenging myself to work within the medium of Processing, which I previously had very little experience, providing a unique opportunity to expand my visual communication skill set as someone who hopes to pursue a career in visual storytelling. I anticipated that this distinct intersection of areas of exploration would create problem-solving situations I would not have encountered otherwise, and it most certainly did. Additionally, my prototype allows audiences a glipse into the power of Processing to produce interactive sketches through algorithmic visual outputs


## Technical Specifications
- Processing Development Environment (PDE)
- Language of Java
- No additional plugins or APIs


## Features and Usage
List the ready features here:
- Title card featuring a one-line description of the project as well as keyboard controls.
- "SPACE" to proceed to the next sketch.
- Can additionally press "ENTER" to redraw each sketch.
- Will loop from beginning when all sketches have been cycled through.


## Screenshots

## Setup
1. Open the .pde file in Processing (Java Mode).
2. Click "Run" to start the prototype.
3. See above (or the title screen text) for keyboard controls.
